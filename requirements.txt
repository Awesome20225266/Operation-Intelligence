# NOTE: On Python 3.14, older `httpcore` (pulled by very old `supabase`) can crash at import time.
# `supabase==2.15.0` uses `httpcore==1.*` (compatible with Python 3.14) and avoids native-build-only deps
# like `pyroaring` seen in some newer Supabase/storage combinations.

# NOTE: `streamlit-aggrid` is optional (code is defensive), and some transitive deps
